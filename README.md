# projet-CNES

Repository containing our master's project on satellite imaging.

The main goal is to create an "impact map" containing information about wildfires, such as the affected area (crops, forests, etc.) and the impact of the ensuing smoke using the wind's direction.

To-do list:

- [ ] (optional) find new API for ~~land cover and~~ wind information
- [ ] try other land cover data with `earth-engine`
- [ ] create convex hull figures from fire coordinates
- [ ] continue working on [main.py](main.py)
- [ ] clean and test new scripts inside [utils](utils/) folder
- [x] test all functions with a new fire
- [ ] make the process as automatic as possible
- [x] add user input where necessary
- [x] add robustness to scripts
- [ ] start documentation
