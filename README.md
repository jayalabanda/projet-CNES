# projet-CNES

Repository containing our master's project on satellite imaging.

The main goal is to create an "impact map" containing information about wildfires, such as the affected area (crops, forests, etc.) or the impact of the ensuing smoke using the wind's direction.

To-do list:

- [X] get wind directions with dates

- create gradient map? or exploit the data somehow

- [ ] use `var_fire` file to retrieve GPS coordinates from pixels
- [ ] determine what zones of terrain are affected
- [ ] make the process as automatic as possible
